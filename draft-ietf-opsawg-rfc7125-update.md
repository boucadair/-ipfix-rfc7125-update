--- abstract

   RFC 7125 revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in RFC 5102
   to reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since RFC 793.
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because some flag values were deprecated since then.

   This document removes stale information from the
   IPFIX registry and avoiding future conflicts with the authoritative
   TCP Header Flags registry.

   This document obsoletes RFC 7125.

#  Introduction

   TCP defines a set of control bits (also known as "flags") for
   managing connections (Section 3.1 of {{!RFC9293}}). The "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   Header Flags" registry was initially set by {{?RFC3168}}, but it was
   populated with only TCP control bits that were defined in {{?RFC3168}}.
   {{!RFC9293}} fixed that by moving that registry to be listed as a
   subregistry under the "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   Parameters" registry, adding bits that had previously been specified
   in {{?RFC0793}}, and removing the NS (Nonce Sum) bit as per {{?RFC8311}}.
   Also, Section 6 of {{!RFC9293}} introduces "Bit Offset" to ease referencing each
   header flag's offset within the 16-bit aligned view of the TCP header
   (Figure 1 of {{!RFC9293}}).  {{TCP-FLAGS}} is thus settled as the
   authoritative reference for the assigned TCP control bits.

   {{?RFC7125}} revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element (IE) that was originally defined in
   {{?RFC5102}} to reflect changes to the TCP Flags header field since
   {{?RFC0793}}.  However, that update is still problematic for
   interoperability because a value was deprecated since then (Section 7
   of {{?RFC8311}}) and, therefore, {{?RFC7125}} risks to deviate from the
   authoritative TCP registry {{TCP-FLAGS}}. This update is also useful
   to enhance observability. For example, network operators can identify
   when packets are being observed with unassigned TCP flags set and,
   therefore, identify which applications in the network should be upgraded
   to reflect the changes to TCP flags that were introduced, e.g., in {{?RFC8311}}.

   This document fixes that problem by removing stale information from
   the IPFIX registry and avoiding future conflicts with the
   authoritative TCP registry {{IPFIX}}.

   Also, because the setting of TCP control bits may be misused in some
   flows (e.g., Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks), an exporter
   has to report all observed control bits even if no meaning is associated
   with a given TCP flag. This document uses a stronger requirement language
   compared to {{?RFC7125}}.  See Section 3 for more details.

#  The tcpControlBits Information Element

ElementId:
: 6

Data Type:
: unsigned16

Data Type Semantics:
: flags

Description:
: TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow.
  This information is encoded as a bit field; for each TCP control
  bit, there is a bit in this set.  The bit is set to 1 if any
  observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit
  set to 1.  The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise.

: As per {{!RFC9293}}, the assignment of the TCP control bits is
  managed by IANA from the "TCP Header Flags" registry {{TCP-FLAGS}}.
  That registry is authoritative to retrieve the most recent TCP
  control bits.

: As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
  zero) of the TCP header {{!RFC9293}} are used to encode the TCP data
  offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
  Element MUST be exported with a value of zero and MUST be ignored
  by the collector. Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to
  encode this value.

: All TCP control bits (including those unassigned) MUST be exported
  as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

: If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding, this
  Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field (i.e.,
  bit offset positions 8 to 15) {{TCP-FLAGS}}. A collector receiving this Information Element
  with reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the
  content of the four bits with bit offset positions 4 to 7.

: Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
  of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
  flags with bit offset positions 4 to 7 SHOULD use reduced-size encoding,
  and only export the least significant 8 bits of this Information
  Element.

: Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
  definition specified that that flags with bit offset positions 8 and 9 must be exported as
  zero, even if observed.  Collectors should therefore not assume
  that a value of zero for these bits in this Information Element
  indicates the bits were never set in the observed traffic,
  especially if these bits are zero in every Flow Record sent by a
  given exporter.

#  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "tcpControlBits" entry of the {{IPFIX}}
   as follows:

   * Update the description of to reflect the change in Section 3.

   * Add {{TCP-FLAGS}} to the Additional Information field.

   * Set the revision to 2 and the revision date to the date of publication of this document.

   * Add this document to the references.

# Security Considerations

  This document does not add new security considerations to those already discussed for IPFIX in {{!RFC7011}}.

# Changes from RFC 7125

* Clean-up the description by removing mentions of stale flag bits, referring to the flag bits by their bit offset position, and relying upon the IANA TCP registry.
* Remove the table of TCP flag bits from the description of the tcpControlBits Information Element.
* Add {{TCP-FLAGS}} to the Additional Information field of the tcpControlBits Information Element.
* Use strong normative language for exporting observed flags.
* Update the references of the tcpControlBits Information Element.
* Bump the revision of the tcpControlBits Information Element.
* Replace obsolete RFCs (e.g., RFC793).
