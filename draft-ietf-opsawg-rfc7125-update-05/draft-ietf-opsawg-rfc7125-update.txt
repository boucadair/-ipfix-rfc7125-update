   An Update to the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
                          Information Element
                draft-ietf-opsawg-rfc7125-update-latest

Abstract

   RFC 7125 revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in RFC 5102
   to reflect changes to the TCP header control bits since RFC 793.
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because some flag values have subsequently been deprecated.

   This document removes stale information from the IPFIX registry and
   avoids future conflicts with the authoritative TCP Header Flags
   registry.

   This document obsoletes RFC 7125.

1.  Introduction

   TCP defines a set of control bits (also known as "flags") for
   managing connections (Section 3.1 of [RFC9293]).  The "Transmission
   Control Protocol (TCP) Header Flags" registry was initially set by
   [RFC3168], but it was populated with only TCP control bits that were
   defined in [RFC3168].  [RFC9293] fixed that by moving that registry
   to be listed as a subregistry under the "Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) Parameters" registry [TCP-FLAGS], adding bits that had
   previously been specified in [RFC0793], and removing the NS (Nonce
   Sum) bit as per [RFC8311].  Also, Section 6 of [RFC9293] introduces
   "Bit Offset" to ease referencing each header flag's offset within the
   16-bit aligned view of the TCP header (Figure 1 of [RFC9293]).
   [TCP-FLAGS] is thus settled as the authoritative reference for the
   assigned TCP control bits.

      The bits in offsets 0 through 3 are not header flags, but the TCP
      segment Data Offset field.

   [RFC7125] revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element (IE) that was originally defined in
   [RFC5102] to reflect changes to the TCP control bits since [RFC0793].
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because a value was deprecated since then (Section 7 of [RFC8311])
   and, therefore, [RFC7125] risks to deviate from the authoritative TCP
   registry [TCP-FLAGS].

   This document fixes that problem by removing stale information from
   the IPFIX registry [IPFIX] and avoiding future conflicts with the
   authoritative TCP registry [TCP-FLAGS].  The update in this document
   is also useful to enhance observability.  For example, network
   operators can identify when packets are being observed with
   unassigned TCP flags set and, therefore, identify which applications
   in the network should be upgraded to reflect the changes to TCP flags
   that were introduced, e.g., in [RFC8311].

   The main changes to [RFC7125] are listed in Appendix A.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].

3.  The tcpControlBits Information Element

   ElementId:  6

   Data Type:  unsigned16

   Data Type Semantics:  flags

   Description:  TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow.
      This information is encoded as a bit field; for each TCP control
      bit, there is a bit in this set.  The bit is set to 1 if any
      observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit
      set to 1.  The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise.

      As per [RFC9293], the assignment of the TCP control bits is
      managed by IANA from the "TCP Header Flags" registry [TCP-FLAGS].
      That registry is authoritative to retrieve the most recent TCP
      control bits.

      As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
      zero) of the TCP header [RFC9293] are used to encode the TCP data
      offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
      Element MUST be exported with a value of zero and MUST be ignored
      by the collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength Information Element to
      encode this value.

      All TCP control bits (including those unassigned) MUST be exported
      as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

      If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding, this
      Information Element covers the low-order octet of this field
      (i.e., bit offset positions 8 to 15) [TCP-FLAGS].  A collector
      receiving this Information Element with reduced-size encoding must
      not assume anything about the content of the four bits with bit
      offset positions 4 to 7.

      Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
      of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
      flags with bit offset positions 4 to 7 SHOULD use reduced-size
      encoding, and only export the least significant 8 bits of this
      Information Element.

      Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
      definition specified that that flags with bit offset positions 8
      and 9 must be exported as zero, even if observed.  Collectors
      should therefore not assume that a value of zero for these bits in
      this Information Element indicates the bits were never set in the
      observed traffic, especially if these bits are zero in every Flow
      Record sent by a given exporter.

      Note also that [TCP-FLAGS] indexes the bit offset from the most-
      significant bit of octet 12 to the least-significant bit of octet
      13 in the TCP header, but the tcpControlBits is encoded as a
      regular unsigned 16 bit integer.

      For example, a tcpControlBits Information Element set to 0x90 is
      used to report TCP control bits for a segment that has CWR
      (Congestion Window Reduced) and ACK flag bits set (that is, bit
      offset positions 8 and 11).

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the "tcpControlBits" entry of the [IPFIX]
   to echo the details provided in Section 3.

5.  Security Considerations

   Because the setting of TCP control bits may be misused in some flows
   (e.g., Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks), an exporter has
   to report all observed control bits even if no meaning is associated
   with a given TCP flag.  This document uses a stronger requirement
   language compared to [RFC7125].

   This document does not add new security considerations to those
   already discussed for IPFIX in [RFC7011].
